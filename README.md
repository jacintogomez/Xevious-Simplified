# xevioussimplified
This is an adaptation of the Namco joystick game Xevious, which was made by editing code from a project in my Python class at Cornell. We were tasked with recreating a simple copy of Space Invaders. After editing some of the main functionalities, I created a unique crossover between the two arcade games.
